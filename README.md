# docker-firefox-build-tools

This repo contains Dockerfiles that can be used to build Firefox, as well as
older versions of Firefox, which have backwards-incompatible dependencies
that can be tedious to change in a local development environment.

## Getting Started

0. Install XQuartz if you are on Mac (see Mac section below for walkthrough)
1. Install Docker on your system
2. Clone this repo
3. In this repo's directory, build the image: `docker build . -f Dockerfile`
4. Get the image's ID: `docker image ls` (it'll be an 11-char hash)
5. Enable X session sharing for local containers: `xhost +localhost`
5. Run the image in a container: `docker run -i -t 8e46a80521b /bin/bash` (replace `8e46a80521b` with your image's ID)
  * except on mac, do this: `docker run -e DISPLAY=docker.for.mac.host.internal:0 -i -t 8e46a80521b /bin/bash` (replace `8e46a80521b` with your image's ID)
7. Inside the container, configure the build: `./mach configure --without-wasm-sandboxed-libraries`
8. Inside the container, after configure runs, build Firefox: `./mach build`

Now you should be able to develop Firefox, run mozregression, etc.

### Installing XQuartz

To actually see the Firefox UI, you'll need to install XQuartz (these instructions come from [https://gist.github.com/sorny/969fe55d85c9b0035b0109a31cbcb088], inlined here to simplify life):

1. Install XQuartz via brew

    `$ brew install --cask xquartz`
 
2. Logout and login of your Mac to activate XQuartz as default X11 server

3. Start XQuartz

    `$ open -a XQuartz`

4. Go to Security Settings and ensure that "Allow connections from network clients" is on
    
5. Restart your Mac and start XQuartz again`

    `$ open -a XQuartz`

6. Check if XQuartz is setup and running correctly
    
    `$ ps aux | grep Xquartz`

7. Ensure that XQuartz is running similar to this: `/opt/X11/bin/Xquartz :0 -listen tcp`
    
    :0 means the display is running on display port 0.
    Important is that its not saying `â€“nolisten tcp` which would block any X11 forwarding to the X11 display.

### Out of space errors

By default, Docker on Mac stores everything in one file with a 64GB limit. It's
quite easy to go over this limit when trying to get an image to build, along
with actually fetching all the dependencies and all the code in m-c.

To make this file larger, open Docker Desktop > Resources, then adjust the
Virtual disk limit slider from the 64GB default to something bigger. 128GB
seems to work for me.

To periodically clear the stuff in this file, do `docker system prune -a -f`
at the command line.
